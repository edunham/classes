Purpose
-------

This tool is meant to help students with long-term planning -- two or 
four-year plans. 

If you already know what classes you plan to take and just want help 
scheduling which section of each class to take this term, check out 
[reggit][reggit] and [reglib][reglib].

explanation
-----------

This half-finished little project started last year in an attempt to code
myself out of job when I was working for the school of EECS as a peer adviser.


It got done enough to pretend to work, then I realized that screen scraping
was going to require a large investment of time before it started to seem easy
to me, and then I abandoned it for a while. 


Then I started looking at my own academic plans for the next 5 terms and
realized I'd forgotten how to make schedules easily, and I wished that my
computer would do it for me. But this code was on my old machine, and not
backed up to anywhere... so GitHub to the rescue! 


So it probably won't work, and code quality is likely rather ugly. But at
least it's in a place where I can get to it when I feel like working on it
now.
