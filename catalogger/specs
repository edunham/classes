Catalogger is to use a Python script with Beautiful Soup 4 to scrape the OSU
catalog and record a class's data in the database (probably using DB-API for
python...)

It should also maintain a list of classes which still need to be recorded in
the database, such as any prereq not already recorded. 

Catalogger will also be responsible for getting a professor's
ratemyprofessors.com (RMP) info for each course. 


I'll use MySQL because it's the path of least resistance -- OSU gives me a
free oniddb which is nice because the hosting takes care of itself. DB-API
